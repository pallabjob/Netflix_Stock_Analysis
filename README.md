Based on the objectives  from Netflix Stock Analysis project, here are potential insights that might emerge after analyzing the data:

Volume of Stock Traded:

Insight: Netflix experiences higher trading volumes during specific events, such as earnings reports, major releases, or market-wide news. Peaks in traded volume often correspond to significant changes in stock price or investor sentiment.
Netflix Stock Price (High, Open, Close):

Netflix Stock Price (Day, Month, Year-wise):

Insight: Stock prices typically exhibit a cyclical pattern. For example, prices may increase around the end of each fiscal quarter, particularly when Netflix releases earnings reports or key announcements. The analysis of yearly trends could show long-term growth, while monthly data may highlight seasonal influences (e.g., holiday season upticks).
Top-5 Dates with Highest Stock Price:

Insight: These dates likely correspond to major milestones for Netflix, such as major product releases, acquisition news, or positive earnings surprises. Understanding these highs can shed light on what drives stock price peaks and may assist in predicting future stock movements during similar events.
Top-5 Dates with Lowest Stock Price:

Insight: These dates may coincide with external market crashes, negative earnings reports, or industry-wide downturns. Identifying patterns or catalysts for these low points could offer valuable lessons for risk management or investment strategy, especially around volatile periods.
